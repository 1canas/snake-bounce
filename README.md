# Snake Bounce 🐍
Snake game developed in C language

### Why Snake Game? 🤔 
During the Information Systems course, in the Fundamentals subject, we were given an exciting challenge: to develop a game using C. With a curious spark in our eyes, we couldn't resist the temptation to choose the classic Snake game and dive into the depths of this programming language
